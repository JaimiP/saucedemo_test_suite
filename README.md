# Tool Choices
I chose to use Cucumber and Ruby to write this test suite because these are the tools used by my current company as well as my Mentor. I chose Cucumber as it is a popular framework and a great way to show how I have learned to organize my code.

2: Open terminal and cd in to your selected directory then into the repo
3: In the terminal execute: cucumber features
